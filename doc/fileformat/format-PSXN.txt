PSXN - Seapath attitude data

Example Record: 

	$PSXN,20,0,0,0,0*3B
	$PSXN,23,0.05,0.05,89.40,0.00*0D

where:
	PSXN,20	Seapath attitude quality
	0			Horizontal Position and velocity quality
					0 = normal
					1 = reduced performace
					2 = invalid data

	0			 Height and vertical velocity quality
					0 = normal
					1 = reduced performace
					2 = invalid data

	0			 Roll and pitch quality
					0 = normal
					1 = reduced performace
					2 = invalid data

	*3B		Checksum always begins with *

------------------------------------
	PSXN,23	Roll, Pitch, Heading and Heave
	0.05		Roll in degrees - positive with port side up
	0.05		Pitch in degrees - positive with bow up
	89.40		Heading in degrees true
	0.00		Heave in meters - positive down
	*0D		checksumalways begins with *
