Purpose: Describe some things to watch out for when processing nav.

Problem: Process stops prematurely.
Check STDOUT to see that navmanager.php process ran to completion.  
If the process stopped prematurely, check the error message (for 
example, no data between cruise dates could indicate either there 
was no data between these cruise dates or that the fileformat was 
wrong). 
Possible solutions: Correct the cruise dates or write a
new fileformat parser.

Problem: Too far from port(s) at start/end of data collection.
Check STDOUT for issue such as ports being far (~>50 km) 
from where data collection began or ended.  
Possible solutions: Correct the cruise dates and/or ports and/or 
check that you have a complete data set.

Problem: Percent completeness is too low or > 100 %.
Check STDOUT to make sure that mode value for epoch interval is 
the primary mode.  If there is more than one mode for interval, 
the percent completeness cannot be determined (and probably 
came out > 100% -- check QA XML).
Possible solution: Delete the bad percentage from the QA XML and
DP XML and add a note to the rating that the metric could not be 
determined.

Check the QA XML output file.  Percentages > 100% or gaps longer 
than a day require further investigation.  
Possible solution: The gap could be real (examine the rawdata), 
the data files could be mis-ordered, or the fileformat parser 
needs fixing. 

Check the DP XML output file.  Percentages > 100% or gaps longer 
than a day require further investigation.  Also worthy of 
investigation are speeds ~> 20 m/s and accelerations ~> +-2 m/s^2.
Possible solution: Insert flag ('#") into NavBestRes product for 
offending record(s) and re-run process from point of QA of 
NavBestRes product.

Check that the NavControl product looks reasonable by plotting
it with the Generic Mapping Tools, including the high-res
coastlines.
